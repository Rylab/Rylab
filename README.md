### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

```npm i && npm run dev```

Dev runs at `http://localhost:7007` as defined in `.env.development`

Define your own local environment by creating a `.env.local` file. This path is in `.gitignore`

```npm ci && npm run build && npm start```

Production builds run at `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default, as defined in `.env.production`

Define your real production environment at build time; never check-in real values. For example, use Vercel or CircleCI project environment settings, Google Secret Manager, Heroku, etc.
